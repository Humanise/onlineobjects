Ever since Bruce Banerdt saw images of Mars's surface as an intern here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) during the Viking landings of the 1970s, he has wanted to know what lies beneath. Now, his goal is within reach, with this week's arrival of NASA's newest martian robot, the InSight lander, which carries instruments designed to probe the planet's interior. “On some level, I've been planning this for 30 years,” says Banerdt, a planetary scientist at JPL and InSight's principal investigator.

On 26 November, the lander's fall from space to the surface made for a tense 6 minutes at JPL's mission control room. But the $814 million lander followed its script to the letter. As it plunged through the atmosphere behind a heat shield, a hush fell over the room during a brief, planned loss of contact. Then came bursts of applause, as communications resumed and the lander relayed signs that it was slowing—first as its parachute deployed and then when its landing thrusters fired. “Thirty meters. Twenty meters,” said Christine Szalai, the JPL engineer narrating its descent. “Touchdown confirmed.” The ensuing celebrations remained somewhat tempered until confirmation came 6 hours later that the lander had unfurled the solar panels that will power it through its 2-year mission. It was NASA's eighth successful Mars landing in nine tries, and a feat that other space agencies have yet to match, aside from the Soviets with their Mars 3 mission, which failed within a minute of its soft landing in 1971.

That engineers could even monitor the landing so closely was itself a leap. NASA's Mars orbiters were not set up or positioned to relay live signals from InSight's descent. Instead, the signals were shuttled to Earth in near–real time by Mars Cube One, a pair of briefcase-size spacecraft with experimental radio antennas that rode to Mars along with InSight. During InSight's 6-minute descent, the duo worked flawlessly before coasting past the planet. “We were all pulling for them,” says Lori Glaze, NASA's acting director of planetary science in Washington, D.C. “They performed absolutely beautifully.”

The spacecraft hit its landing site, a vast lava plain near the equator called Elysium Planitia, close to its bull's-eye, says Tom Hoffman, the project manager at JPL. NASA chose the tropical site for its abundant sunlight and apparent lack of rocks, which could have upset the landing and made it hard to deploy the instruments. InSight's first image, speckled by dust on the lens's transparent cap, showed a rusty plain, featureless aside from a rock near the lander's body. “It does look like a parking lot,” Hoffman says. A second photo showed the team may just have been lucky: The terrain is rockier beyond InSight's immediate vicinity.

The lander is designed to reveal the dimensions and composition of the planet's crust, mantle, and core, details that could help scientists understand how planets lose their magnetic fields or develop plate tectonics. It also marks NASA's return to planetary seismology after 4 decades. The two Viking landers both carried seismometers, but one failed and the other was bedeviled by noise.

Over the next couple of weeks, scientists will plan InSight's next two feats: wielding its robotic arm to place its seismometer and heat probe. The arm will first pluck the volleyball-size seismometer from the lander's deck and set it on the ground, with its power provided by a tether; an encircling wind and heat shield, like a bell jar, will follow. The seismometer, developed with French partners, will be placed as far out as possible—up to the arm's limit of some 1.5 meters—to avoid wind-generated noise channeled into the ground by the lander's legs. Each step will take days to test and confirm. “I liken it to playing that claw game at a carnival, but you're doing it with a really, really valuable prize,” says Elizabeth Barrett, a planetary scientist at JPL. “And you're doing it via remote control on another planet.”

The heat probe, developed by German partners, will be deployed soon afterward, in January 2019. Over several weeks, thousands of strokes of a tungsten hammer will drive a rod 5 meters into the surface, slipping around small rocks—and hopefully not hitting large ones. The seismometer will listen to the blows to infer the composition of nearby martian crust. At first glance, dust covering one of the lander's feet indicates a sandy surface that could be easier to penetrate, Banerdt says. Once ensconced, the probe will measure how much heat is escaping from the planet, and how quickly—clues to how much heat remains in its interior, and when it was most volcanically active.

Meanwhile, the InSight team will calibrate the seismometer, which is so sensitive that, if placed at JPL, it could detect the churn of Pacific Ocean surf, nearly 40 kilometers away. By March 2019, it is likely to be listening, waiting for a marsquake to strike.

A variety of tricks will allow InSight to use its single seismic station to infer the strength and location of common, small earthquakes. These techniques depend on a sort of circular logic, using models of the planet's interior to understand the interior. But quakes larger than magnitude 5 will set Mars to ringing like a gong. Overlapping surface waves, taking different routes around the planet, will allow InSight to precisely determine the marsquake's strength and location with minimal model reliance. Knowing these details will help investigators interpret other seismic waves from the same quake that pass directly through the planet's deep interior. Such a seismic boon is far from guaranteed—only two or three large marsquakes are likely to occur in the lander's first 2 years.

Banerdt plans to buy two picture frames. One will be filled with InSight's first, speckled image. The second will remain empty until Banerdt gets a squiggly seismogram from that first big quake. “That's going to be the payoff,” he says. “That's going to be my legacy.”
