But if you have been working in this industry for long enough, you have probably seen this happen before. From “webmaster”, to “information architect”, to “interaction designer”, to “UX designer”, we have always been able to adapt what we do and call ourselves – while maintaining our mission of creating meaningful experiences for people.</p>
<p>What we see now is not any different. Our field is maturing, budgets are increasing, and the design landscape is getting more complex and competitive. We can’t expect every designer to be the jack of all trades. We can't be doing our job in 2018 the same way we did in 2008.</p>
<p>As the broad "UX designer" title starts to dissolve, we see fellow designers focusing on new paths and specializations:</p>
<p><strong>Some designers are adventuring in new fields and technologies</strong>, like virtual reality, conversational design, voice interfaces;</p><p><strong>Some are focusing on more specific areas of the design craft</strong>, like motion design, prototyping, UX writing;</p><p><strong>Some are updating their titles to Product Designers</strong>, broadening their scope beyond interaction design to focus more on product strategy and business.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/product-design/home">shift from UX Design to Product Design</a> is only accelerating in 2018. As our role and responsibilities grow inside our companies, understanding more about business and design strategy becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>Being comfortable with business lingo is just the first step. We have to be able to talk to our business peers about lead generation, CRM, metrics, EBITDA, targeting, retargeting, revenue models, search engine marketing, direct response landing pages. Even more than that, we have to know when and where to put on business hats ourselves. A blue-sky design proposal might sound great in theory, but if not feasible from a business perspective, it shouldn't be where you invest most of your time.</p></body></html></html>
