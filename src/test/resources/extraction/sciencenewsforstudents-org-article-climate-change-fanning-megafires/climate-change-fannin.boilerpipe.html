The edge of that circle is defined as the northernmost point at which the sun is visible on the northern winter solstice and the southernmost point at which the midnight sun can be seen on the northern summer solstice. The high Arctic is that most northerly third of this region. It’s a region dominated by snow cover much of the year.</p><p><strong>Arctic Circle</strong>     The northernmost point at which the sun is visible on the northern winter solstice and the southernmost point at which the midnight sun can be seen on the northern summer solstice.</p><p><strong>atmosphere</strong>     The envelope of gases surrounding Earth or another planet.</p><p><strong>behavior</strong>     The way something, often a person, other organism or phenomenon acts or conducts itself.</p><p><strong>climate</strong>     The weather conditions that typically exist in one area, in general, or over a long period.</p><p><strong>climate change</strong>     Long-term, significant change in the climate of Earth. It can happen naturally or in response to human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.</p><p><strong>computer model</strong>     A program that runs on a computer that creates a model, or simulation, of a real-world feature, phenomenon or event.</p><p><strong>computer program</strong>     A set of instructions that a computer uses to perform some analysis or computation. The writing of these instructions is known as computer programming.</p><p><strong>drought</strong>     An extended period of abnormally low rainfall; a shortage of water resulting from this.</p><p><strong>ecology</strong>      A branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings. A scientist who works in this field is called an ecologist.</p><p><strong>equation</strong>     In mathematics, the statement that two quantities are equal. In geometry, equations are often used to determine the shape of a curve or surface.</p><p><strong>flammable</strong>     Something that can burn (go up in flames) easily.</p><p><strong>fuel</strong>     Any material that will release energy during a controlled chemical or nuclear reaction.</p><p><strong>humidity</strong>     A measure of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. (Air with a lot of water vapor in it is known as humid.)</p><p><strong>ignition</strong>     (in chemistry) The act of igniting a fuel in combustion, such as natural gas or gasoline.</p><p><strong>La Niña</strong>     Extended periods when the surface water around the equator in the eastern Pacific cools for long stretches of time. Scientists will announce the arrival of a La Niña (lah NEEN yah) when the average temperature there drops by at least 0.4° C (0.72° degree F). Impacts on global weather during a La Niña tend to be the reverse of those triggered by an El Niño: Now, Central and South America may face severe droughts while Australia floods.</p><p><strong>litter</strong>     Material that lies around in the open, having been discarded or left to fall where it may. (in biology) Decaying leaves and other plant matter on the surface of a forest floor.</p><p><strong>meteorologist</strong>     Someone who studies weather and climate events.</p><p><strong>model</strong>     A simulation of a real-world event (usually using a computer) that has been developed to predict one or more likely outcomes. Or an individual that is meant to display how something would work in or look on others.</p><p><strong>NASA</strong>     Short for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Created in 1958, this U.S. agency has become a leader in space research and in stimulating public interest in space exploration. It was through NASA that the United States sent people into orbit and ultimately to the moon. It also has sent research craft to study planets and other celestial objects in our solar system.</p><p><strong>particle</strong>     A minute amount of something.</p><p><strong>phenomenon</strong>     Something that is surprising or unusual.</p><p><strong>physical</strong>     (adj.) A term for things that exist in the real world, as opposed to in memories or the imagination. It can also refer to properties of materials that are due to their size and non-chemical interactions (such as when one block slams with force into another).</p><p><strong>precipitation</strong>      (in meteorology) A term for water falling from the sky. It can be in any form, from rain and sleet to snow or hail.</p><p><strong>risk</strong>     The chance or mathematical likelihood that some bad thing might happen.</p><p><strong>satellite</strong>     A moon orbiting a planet or a vehicle or other manufactured object that orbits some celestial body in space.</p><p><strong>simulate</strong>     To deceive in some way by imitating the form or function of something. A simulated dietary fat, for instance, may deceive the mouth that it has tasted a real fat because it has the same feel on the tongue — without having any calories. A simulated sense of touch may fool the brain into thinking a finger has touched something even though a hand may no longer exists and has been replaced by a synthetic limb. (in computing) To try and imitate the conditions, functions or appearance of something. Computer programs that do this are referred to as <strong>simulations</strong>.</p><p><strong>vegetation</strong>     Leafy, green plants. The term refers to the collective community of plants in some area. Typically these do not include tall trees, but instead plants that are shrub height or shorter.</p><p><strong>water vapor</strong>     Water in its gaseous state, capable of being suspended in the air.</p><p><strong>weather</strong>     Conditions in the atmosphere at a localized place and a particular time. It is usually described in terms of particular features, such as air pressure, humidity, moisture, any precipitation (rain, snow or ice), temperature and wind speed. Weather constitutes the actual conditions that occur at any time and place. It’s different from climate, which is a description of the conditions that tend to occur in some general region during a particular month or season.</p></div></body></html></html>
