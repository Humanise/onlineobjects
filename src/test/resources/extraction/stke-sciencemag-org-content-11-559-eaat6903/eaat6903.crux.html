<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><html><head /><body><p>The scaffold protein p62, also called SQSTM1 (encoded by <em>SQSTM1</em>), is involved in several homeostatic processes such as macroautophagy (henceforth referred to as autophagy) (<a href="#ref-1"><em>1</em></a>–<a href="#ref-3"><em>3</em></a>). The many domains within p62 protein facilitate protein-protein interactions for its various cellular roles (fig. S1A). For example, p62 promotes autophagic turnover of ubiquitylated cargo by binding LC3-like proteins and ubiquitin chains, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation through atypical protein kinases C (aPKCs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1), redox stress response through the E3 ligase kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), and cell growth and anabolism through the Ras-related guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding (RAG) family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) that regulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). As an autophagy adaptor, p62 facilitates both antimicrobial immunity and homeostasis. During xenophagy, it targets intracellular pathogens and restricts their replication, and during mitophagy, it facilitates the turnover of damaged mitochondria (<a href="#ref-4"><em>4</em></a>). More than 30 disease-linked nonsynonymous mutations in human <em>SQSTM1</em> are linked to hereditary inflammatory diseases (<a href="#ref-5"><em>5</em></a>–<a href="#ref-7"><em>7</em></a>). These include Paget’s disease of the bone, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles. Most mutations map to the ubiquitin binding–associated region (UBA) (fig. S1A) and interfere with ubiquitin binding, which, in some cases, alter autophagy responses (<a href="#ref-5"><em>5</em></a>–<a href="#ref-7"><em>7</em></a>). Because of the multifaceted nature of p62 and ubiquitous expression, the mechanisms by which natural mutations affect some of the functions of p62 in specific cell types and cause disease have remained unclear. Therefore, a better understanding of context-specific signaling through p62 is essential.</p>
<p>Cross-talk between autophagy and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) promotes antimicrobial immunity (<a href="#ref-8"><em>8</em></a>–<a href="#ref-10"><em>10</em></a>). Unlike other TLRs, TLR3 uses only the adaptor protein TRIF [TIR-Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain–containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-β (IFN-β)], which recruits RIPK1 for downstream signaling. TLR3 detects double-stranded RNA and stimulates proinflammatory cytokine induction through NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and type I IFN production through IFN regulatory factor 3. Natural loss-of-function or dominant-negative deficiencies in human TLR3 signaling genes cause pediatric susceptibility to herpes simplex virus infections, which point to a key role for TLR3 in humans (<a href="#ref-11"><em>11</em></a>). The interaction of the kinase RIPK1 with the protease caspase-8 determines the outcomes of TLR3 signaling in a context-specific and cell type–dependent manner (<a href="#ref-12"><em>12</em></a>). During antimicrobial responses, RIPK1 becomes polyubiquitylated, restrains caspase-8 activity, and promotes cell survival, gene expression, and immunity (<a href="#ref-12"><em>12</em></a>–<a href="#ref-15"><em>15</em></a>). In contrast to normal fibroblasts, macrophages, and dendritic cells, TLR3 signaling in several cancer cell types, such as melanomas and breast cancer cells, can trigger necrotic cell death (<a href="#ref-16"><em>16</em></a>–<a href="#ref-20"><em>20</em></a>). These findings have led to an interest in developing polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic TLR3 ligand, as an anticancer adjuvant (<a href="#ref-21"><em>21</em></a>, <a href="#ref-22"><em>22</em></a>). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of human TLR3 signaling is also important from a therapeutic point of view.</p>
<p>The molecular basis for the functional separation of the cellular pool of p62 in different pathways remains poorly understood. For example, nutrient starvation of cells triggers autophagic turnover of cytosolic contents to sustain metabolism; p62 serves as a selective cargo receptor for autophagy and is itself turned over within autophagolysosomes. On the other hand, during nutrient-replete conditions, such as plentiful amino acid supply, p62 is involved in activating the kinase in mTORC1 (<a href="#ref-23"><em>23</em></a>–<a href="#ref-25"><em>25</em></a>). mTORC1 integrates nutrient availability and growth factor signaling and phosphorylates substrates such as the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) and eIF4E-binding protein to promote protein translation, anabolism, and cell growth (<a href="#ref-26"><em>26</em></a>, <a href="#ref-27"><em>27</em></a>). Notably, mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits proteins that initiate autophagy. Autophagy and mTORC1 thus oppose each other during nutrient-deplete and nutrient-replete conditions (<a href="#ref-28"><em>28</em></a>). However, because p62 can be rapidly turned over by starvation-induced autophagy (<a href="#ref-29"><em>29</em></a>), how p62 participates in the physiologically opposing mTORC1 pathway when nutrients become available is not clear.</p>
<p>Previous in vitro work suggested that caspases can cleave several autophagy proteins, including p62 (<a href="#ref-30"><em>30</em></a>, <a href="#ref-31"><em>31</em></a>). While studying TLR3 signaling in human donor–derived skin fibroblasts, we found that caspase-8 proteolytically trimmed p62 into a stable protein, which we called p62. Our studies revealed that proteolysis of p62 into p62 was regulated and that p62 activated mTORC1. We found two rare natural polymorphisms in <em>SQSTM1</em> that abrogated its cleavage by caspase-8 and specifically impaired mTORC1 functions. These findings provide new molecular insights into the detrimental effects of these mutations in <em>SQSTM1</em> and the exclusive and opposing roles of full-length p62 in autophagy and antimicrobial xenophagy and of p62 in mTORC1 activation.</p></body></html></html>
