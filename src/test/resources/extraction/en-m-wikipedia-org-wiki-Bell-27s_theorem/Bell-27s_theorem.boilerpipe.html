Bell concluded:
</p><blockquote><p>In a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to determine the results of individual measurements, without changing the statistical predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another instrument, however remote.

</p><blockquote><p>There is a way to escape the inference of <a href="/wiki/Superluminal" title="Superluminal">superluminal</a> speeds and spooky action at a distance.

Suppose the world is super-deterministic, with not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behavior, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined, including the 'decision' by the experimenter to carry out one set of measurements rather than another, the difficulty disappears. There is no need for a faster-than-light signal to tell particle A what measurement has been carried out on particle B, because the universe, including particle A, already 'knows' what that measurement, and its outcome, will be.<sup><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p></blockquote><div>Example of simple Bell type inequality and its violation in quantum mechanics.

In a well-known 1935 paper, <a href="/wiki/Boris_Podolsky" title="Boris Podolsky">Boris Podolsky</a> and co-authors Einstein and <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Rosen" title="Nathan Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a> (collectively "EPR") sought to demonstrate by the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">EPR paradox</a> that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  This provided hope that a more complete (and less troubling) theory might one day be discovered.  But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of locality and realism (together called "local realism" or "<a href="/wiki/Local_hidden_variables" title="Local hidden variables">local hidden variables</a>", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_locality" title="Principle of locality">locality</a> meant no instantaneous <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">("spooky") action at a distance</a>; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably <a href="/wiki/Bohr%E2%80%93Einstein_debates" title="Bohr–Einstein debates">between Einstein and Niels Bohr</a>.
</p><p>In his groundbreaking 1964 paper, "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox",<sup><a href="#cite_note-Bell1964-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> physicist <a href="/wiki/John_Stewart_Bell" title="John Stewart Bell">John Stewart Bell</a> presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox.  Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of a measurement there (and vice versa).  After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics theory.
</p><p>In experimental tests following Bell's example, now using <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">quantum entanglement</a> of photons instead of electrons, <a href="/wiki/John_Clauser" title="John Clauser">John Clauser</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Freedman" title="Stuart Freedman">Stuart Freedman</a> (1972) and <a href="/wiki/Alain_Aspect" title="Alain Aspect">Alain Aspect</a>et al. (1981) demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct in this regard, although relying on additional unverifiable assumptions that open <a href="/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments" title="Loopholes in Bell test experiments">loopholes</a> for local realism.
</p><p>In October 2015, Hensen and co-workers<sup><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-7">[7]</a></sup> reported that they performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject at least one of the principles of locality, realism, or <a href="/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments#Free_choice_of_detector_orientations" title="Loopholes in Bell test experiments">freedom-of-choice</a> (the last "could" lead to alternative <a href="/wiki/Superdeterminism" title="Superdeterminism">superdeterministic</a> theories).<sup><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as "not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.
</p></div></div><div>Overview<a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_theorem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Overview">Edit</a><div><p>Bell's theorem states that any physical theory that incorporates <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_locality#Local_realism" title="Principle of locality">local realism</a> cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanical theory.  Because numerous experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanical theory, and show differences between correlations that could not be explained by local hidden variables, the experimental results have been taken by many as refuting the concept of local realism as an explanation of the physical phenomena under test. For a hidden variable theory, if Bell's conditions are correct, the results that agree with quantum mechanical theory appear to indicate <a href="/wiki/Superluminal" title="Superluminal">superluminal</a> (faster-than-light) effects, in contradiction to the principle of locality.
</p><p>These three key concepts – locality, realism, freedom – are highly technical and much debated. In particular, the concept of realism is now somewhat different from what it was in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called <a href="/wiki/Counterfactual_definiteness" title="Counterfactual definiteness">counterfactual definiteness</a>; it means that we may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted <a href="/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" title="Quantum field theory">quantum field theories</a>are local in the terminology of the <a href="/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory)" title="Lagrangian (field theory)">Lagrangian formalism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Local_quantum_field_theory" title="Local quantum field theory">axiomatic approach</a>.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.

A source produces a <a href="/wiki/Singlet_state" title="Singlet state">singlet</a> pair, one particle is sent to one location, and the other is sent to another location. A <a href="/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics" title="Measurement in quantum mechanics">measurement</a> of the entangled property is performed at various angles at each location. The scheme for measurements on <a href="/wiki/Photons" title="Photons">photons</a> looks very similar: the quantum state is different but has very similar properties.</div></div><p>The theorem is usually proved by consideration of a quantum system of two <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">entangled</a><a href="/wiki/Qubit" title="Qubit">qubits</a>. The most common examples concern systems of particles that are entangled in <a href="/wiki/Spin_(physics)" title="Spin (physics)">spin</a> or <a href="/wiki/Polarization_(waves)" title="Polarization (waves)">polarization</a>. Quantum mechanics allows predictions of correlations that would be observed if these two particles have their spin or polarization measured in different directions. Bell showed that if a local hidden variable theory holds, then these correlations would have to satisfy certain constraints, called Bell inequalities. However, for the quantum correlations arising in the specific example considered, those constraints are not satisfied, hence the phenomenon being studied cannot be explained by a local hidden variables theory.
</p><p>Following the argument in the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox</a> paper (but using the example of spin, as in <a href="/wiki/David_Bohm" title="David Bohm">David Bohm</a>'s version of the EPR argument<sup><a href="#cite_note-Bell1964-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>), Bell considered an experiment in which there are "a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the <a href="/wiki/Singlet_state" title="Singlet state">singlet spin state</a> and moving freely in opposite directions."<sup><a href="#cite_note-Bell1964-4">[4]</a></sup> The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up (+) or spin-down (−); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.
</p><p>The probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or antiparallel alignments (0° or 180°). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the probability of the same result with parallel (antiparallel) alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.
</p><p>Bell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The <a href="/wiki/Quantum_correlation" title="Quantum correlation">correlation</a> of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the products of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of <a href="/wiki/Correlation" title="Correlation">correlation</a> in statistics. The quantum physicist's "correlation" is the statistician's "raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product <a href="/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)" title="Moment (mathematics)">moment</a>". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is -1; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Pauli_operator" title="Pauli operator">Measuring the spin</a> of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., along the same axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is in accord with the above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns should be read as examples of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.

In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) reality (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) locality (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false.
</p><p>In two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more <a href="/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory" title="Hidden variable theory">hidden variables</a> than merely the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">element of physical reality</a> in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below.  Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to <a href="/wiki/Stochastic" title="Stochastic">stochastic</a> theories<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clauser%E2%80%93Horne-16">[16]</a></sup> as well, and it was also realised<sup><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> that the theorem is not so much about hidden variables, as about the outcomes of measurements that could have been taken instead of the one actually taken. Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of <a href="/wiki/Counterfactual_definiteness" title="Counterfactual definiteness">counterfactual definiteness</a>.
</p><p>After the EPR paper, quantum mechanics was in an unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, in the sense that it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical <a href="/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics)" title="Observer (quantum physics)">observers</a>, now commonly referred to as <a href="/wiki/Alice_and_Bob" title="Alice and Bob">Alice and Bob</a>, perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a <a href="/wiki/Spin_singlet" title="Spin singlet">spin singlet</a> state. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the x axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an element of physical reality, or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.
</p><p>In QM, predictions are formulated in terms of <a href="/wiki/Probability" title="Probability">probabilities</a> — for example, the probability that an <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electron</a> will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a definite position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a hidden variables theory, might be able to predict those quantities exactly, while at the same time also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.
