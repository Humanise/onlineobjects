In a well-known 1935 paper, <a href="/wiki/Boris_Podolsky" title="Boris Podolsky">Boris Podolsky</a> and co-authors Einstein and <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Rosen" title="Nathan Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a> (collectively "EPR") sought to demonstrate by the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">EPR paradox</a> that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  This provided hope that a more complete (and less troubling) theory might one day be discovered.  But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of locality and realism (together called "local realism" or "<a href="/wiki/Local_hidden_variables" title="Local hidden variables">local hidden variables</a>", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_locality" title="Principle of locality">locality</a> meant no instantaneous <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">("spooky") action at a distance</a>; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably <a href="/wiki/Bohr%E2%80%93Einstein_debates" title="Bohr–Einstein debates">between Einstein and Niels Bohr</a>.
</p><p>In his groundbreaking 1964 paper, "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox",<sup><a href="#cite_note-Bell1964-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> physicist <a href="/wiki/John_Stewart_Bell" title="John Stewart Bell">John Stewart Bell</a> presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox.  Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of a measurement there (and vice versa).  After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics theory.
</p><p>In experimental tests following Bell's example, now using <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">quantum entanglement</a> of photons instead of electrons, <a href="/wiki/John_Clauser" title="John Clauser">John Clauser</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Freedman" title="Stuart Freedman">Stuart Freedman</a> (1972) and <a href="/wiki/Alain_Aspect" title="Alain Aspect">Alain Aspect</a>et al. (1981) demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct in this regard, although relying on additional unverifiable assumptions that open <a href="/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments" title="Loopholes in Bell test experiments">loopholes</a> for local realism.
</p><p>In October 2015, Hensen and co-workers<sup><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-7">[7]</a></sup> reported that they performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject at least one of the principles of locality, realism, or <a href="/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments#Free_choice_of_detector_orientations" title="Loopholes in Bell test experiments">freedom-of-choice</a> (the last "could" lead to alternative <a href="/wiki/Superdeterminism" title="Superdeterminism">superdeterministic</a> theories).<sup><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as "not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.
</p></div><h2><div>Overview<a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_theorem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Overview">Edit</a></div></h2><div><p>Bell's theorem states that any physical theory that incorporates <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_locality#Local_realism" title="Principle of locality">local realism</a> cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanical theory.  Because numerous experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanical theory, and show differences between correlations that could not be explained by local hidden variables, the experimental results have been taken by many as refuting the concept of local realism as an explanation of the physical phenomena under test. For a hidden variable theory, if Bell's conditions are correct, the results that agree with quantum mechanical theory appear to indicate <a href="/wiki/Superluminal" title="Superluminal">superluminal</a> (faster-than-light) effects, in contradiction to the principle of locality.
</p><p>These three key concepts – locality, realism, freedom – are highly technical and much debated. In particular, the concept of realism is now somewhat different from what it was in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called <a href="/wiki/Counterfactual_definiteness" title="Counterfactual definiteness">counterfactual definiteness</a>; it means that we may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted <a href="/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" title="Quantum field theory">quantum field theories</a>are local in the terminology of the <a href="/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory)" title="Lagrangian (field theory)">Lagrangian formalism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Local_quantum_field_theory" title="Local quantum field theory">axiomatic approach</a>.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.

A source produces a <a href="/wiki/Singlet_state" title="Singlet state">singlet</a> pair, one particle is sent to one location, and the other is sent to another location. A <a href="/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics" title="Measurement in quantum mechanics">measurement</a> of the entangled property is performed at various angles at each location. The scheme for measurements on <a href="/wiki/Photons" title="Photons">photons</a> looks very similar: the quantum state is different but has very similar properties.</div></div><p>The theorem is usually proved by consideration of a quantum system of two <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">entangled</a><a href="/wiki/Qubit" title="Qubit">qubits</a>. The most common examples concern systems of particles that are entangled in <a href="/wiki/Spin_(physics)" title="Spin (physics)">spin</a> or <a href="/wiki/Polarization_(waves)" title="Polarization (waves)">polarization</a>. Quantum mechanics allows predictions of correlations that would be observed if these two particles have their spin or polarization measured in different directions. Bell showed that if a local hidden variable theory holds, then these correlations would have to satisfy certain constraints, called Bell inequalities. However, for the quantum correlations arising in the specific example considered, those constraints are not satisfied, hence the phenomenon being studied cannot be explained by a local hidden variables theory.
</p><p>Following the argument in the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox</a> paper (but using the example of spin, as in <a href="/wiki/David_Bohm" title="David Bohm">David Bohm</a>'s version of the EPR argument<sup><a href="#cite_note-Bell1964-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>), Bell considered an experiment in which there are "a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the <a href="/wiki/Singlet_state" title="Singlet state">singlet spin state</a> and moving freely in opposite directions."<sup><a href="#cite_note-Bell1964-4">[4]</a></sup> The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up (+) or spin-down (−); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.
</p><p>The probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or antiparallel alignments (0° or 180°). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the probability of the same result with parallel (antiparallel) alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.
</p><p>Bell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The <a href="/wiki/Quantum_correlation" title="Quantum correlation">correlation</a> of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the products of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of <a href="/wiki/Correlation" title="Correlation">correlation</a> in statistics. The quantum physicist's "correlation" is the statistician's "raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product <a href="/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)" title="Moment (mathematics)">moment</a>". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is -1; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Pauli_operator" title="Pauli operator">Measuring the spin</a> of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., along the same axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is in accord with the above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns should be read as examples of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.

In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) reality (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) locality (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false.
</p><p>In two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more <a href="/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory" title="Hidden variable theory">hidden variables</a> than merely the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">element of physical reality</a> in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below.  Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to <a href="/wiki/Stochastic" title="Stochastic">stochastic</a> theories<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clauser%E2%80%93Horne-16">[16]</a></sup> as well, and it was also realised<sup><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> that the theorem is not so much about hidden variables, as about the outcomes of measurements that could have been taken instead of the one actually taken. Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of <a href="/wiki/Counterfactual_definiteness" title="Counterfactual definiteness">counterfactual definiteness</a>.
</p><p>After the EPR paper, quantum mechanics was in an unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, in the sense that it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical <a href="/wiki/Observer_(quantum_physics)" title="Observer (quantum physics)">observers</a>, now commonly referred to as <a href="/wiki/Alice_and_Bob" title="Alice and Bob">Alice and Bob</a>, perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a <a href="/wiki/Spin_singlet" title="Spin singlet">spin singlet</a> state. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the x axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an element of physical reality, or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.
</p><p>In QM, predictions are formulated in terms of <a href="/wiki/Probability" title="Probability">probabilities</a> — for example, the probability that an <a href="/wiki/Electron" title="Electron">electron</a> will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a definite position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a hidden variables theory, might be able to predict those quantities exactly, while at the same time also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.

A common approach is the following:

The hidden parameter is often thought of as being associated with the source but it can just as well also contain components associated with the two measurement devices.
</p></div><h2><div>Bell inequalities<a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_theorem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Bell inequalities">Edit</a></div></h2><div><p>Bell inequalities concern measurements made by observers on pairs of particles that have interacted and then separated. Assuming local realism, certain constraints must hold on the relationships between the correlations between subsequent measurements of the particles under various possible measurement settings. Let A and B be as above. Define for the present purposes three correlation functions:
</p><ul><li>Let C<sub>e</sub>(a, b) denote the experimentally measured correlation defined by
<dl><dd>C</dd></dl></li></ul><dl><dd>{\displaystyle C_{h}(a,c)-C_{h}(b,a)-C_{h}(b,c)\leq 1,} </dd></dl><p>where a, b and c refer to three arbitrary settings of the two analysers. This inequality is however restricted in its application to the rather special case in which the outcomes on both sides of the experiment are always exactly anticorrelated whenever the analysers are parallel. The advantage of restricting attention to this special case is the resulting simplicity of the derivation. In experimental work, the inequality is not very useful because it is hard, if not impossible, to create perfect anti-correlation.
</p><p>This simple form has an intuitive explanation, however. It is equivalent to the following elementary result from probability theory. Consider three (highly correlated, and possibly biased) coin-flips X, Y, and Z, with the property that:
</p><ol><li>X and Y give the same outcome (both heads or both tails) 99% of the time</li><li>Y and Z also give the same outcome 99% of the time,</li></ol><p>then X and Z must also yield the same outcome at least 98% of the time. The number of mismatches between X and Y (1/100) plus the number of mismatches between Y and Z (1/100) are together the maximum possible number of mismatches between X and Z (a simple <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inequalities" title="Fréchet inequalities">Boole–Fréchet inequality</a>).
</p><p>Imagine a pair of particles that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how they are going to be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.
</p><p>Start with one setting exactly opposite to the other. All the pairs of particles give the same outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A small fraction of the pairs, say f, now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2f.
</p><p>Compare this with the predictions from quantum mechanics for the singlet state. For a small angle θ, measured in radians, the chance of a different outcome is approximately f{\displaystyle f_{2}=(2\theta )^{2}/4=2^{2}\theta ^{2}/4\approx 4f_{1}} . But we just argued that it cannot be more than 2 times as large.
</p><p>This intuitive formulation is due to <a href="/wiki/David_Mermin" title="David Mermin">David Mermin</a>. The small-angle limit is discussed in Bell's original article, and therefore goes right back to the origin of the Bell inequalities.

Each photon encounters a two-channel polariser whose orientation (a or b) can be set by the experimenter. Emerging signals from each channel are detected and coincidences of four types (++, −−, +− and −+) counted by the coincidence monitor.</div></div><div>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Bell_test_experiments" title="Bell test experiments">Bell test experiments</a></div><p>Experimental tests can determine whether the Bell inequalities required by local realism hold up to the empirical evidence.
</p><p>Actually, most experiments have been performed using polarization of photons rather than spin of electrons (or other spin-half particles). The quantum state of the pair of entangled photons is not the singlet state, and the correspondence between angles and outcomes is different from that in the spin-half set-up. The polarization of a photon is measured in a pair of perpendicular directions. Relative to a given orientation, polarization is either vertical (denoted by V or by +) or horizontal (denoted by H or by -). The photon pairs are generated in the quantum state
</p><dl><dd>1</dd></dl><p>⟩{\displaystyle |H\rangle }  denotes the state of a single vertically or horizontally polarized photon, respectively (relative to a fixed and common reference direction for both particles).
</p><p>When the polarization of both photons is measured in the same direction, both give the same outcome: perfect correlation. When measured at directions making an angle 45° with one another, the outcomes are completely random (uncorrelated). Measuring at directions at 90° to one another, the two are perfectly anti-correlated. In general, when the polarizers are at an angle θ to one another, the correlation is cos(2θ). So relative to the correlation function for the singlet state of spin half particles, we have a positive rather than a negative cosine function, and angles are halved: the correlation is periodic with period π instead of 2π.
</p><p>Bell's inequalities are tested by "coincidence counts" from a Bell test experiment such as the optical one shown in the diagram.  Pairs of particles are emitted as a result of a quantum process, analysed with respect to some key property such as polarisation direction, then detected.  The setting (orientations) of the analysers are selected by the experimenter.
</p><p>Bell test experiments to date overwhelmingly violate Bell's inequality.
</p><h3>Two classes of Bell inequalities<a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_theorem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: Two classes of Bell inequalities">Edit</a></h3><p>The fair sampling problem was faced openly in the 1970s. In early designs of their 1973 experiment, Freedman and Clauser<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clauser%E2%80%93Freedman-19">[19]</a></sup> used fair sampling in the form of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clauser_1969-18">[18]</a></sup>) hypothesis. However, shortly afterwards Clauser and Horne<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clauser%E2%80%93Horne-16">[16]</a></sup>  made the important distinction between inhomogeneous (IBI) and homogeneous (HBI) Bell inequalities. Testing an IBI requires that we compare certain coincidence rates in two separated detectors with the singles rates of the two detectors. Nobody needed to perform the experiment, because singles rates with all detectors in the 1970s were at least ten times all the coincidence rates. So, taking into account this low detector efficiency, the QM prediction actually satisfied the IBI. To arrive at an experimental design in which the QM prediction violates IBI we require detectors whose efficiency exceeds 82.8% for singlet states,<sup><a href="#cite_note-Garg_&amp;_Mermin,_1987-20">[20]</a></sup> but have very low dark rate and short dead and resolving times. This is now within reach.
</p><div>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments" title="Loopholes in Bell test experiments">Loopholes in Bell test experiments</a></div><p>Because, at that time, even the best detectors didn't detect a large fraction of all photons, Clauser and Horne<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clauser%E2%80%93Horne-16">[16]</a></sup> recognized that testing Bell's inequality required some extra assumptions. They introduced the No Enhancement Hypothesis (NEH):
</p><blockquote><p>A light signal, originating in an <a href="/wiki/Atomic_cascade" title="Atomic cascade">atomic cascade</a> for example, has a certain probability of activating a detector.  Then, if a polarizer is interposed between the cascade and the detector, the detection probability cannot increase.
</p></blockquote><p>Given this assumption, there is a Bell inequality between the coincidence rates with polarizers and coincidence rates without polarizers.
</p><p>The experiment was performed by Freedman and Clauser,<sup><a href="#cite_note-Clauser%E2%80%93Freedman-19">[19]</a></sup> who found that the Bell's inequality was violated. So the no-enhancement hypothesis cannot be true in a local hidden variables model.
</p><p>While early experiments used atomic cascades,  later experiments have used parametric down-conversion, following a suggestion by Reid and Walls,<sup><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> giving improved generation and detection properties. As a result, the most recent experiments with photons no longer suffer from the detection loophole (see <a href="/wiki/Bell_test_experiments" title="Bell test experiments">Bell test experiments</a>). This makes the photon the first experimental system for which all main experimental loopholes have been surmounted, albeit presently only in separate experiments (Giustina et al. (2013), Bell violation using entangled photons without the fair-sampling assumption, Nature 497, 227–230; B.G. Christensen et al. (2013), Detection-Loophole-Free Test of Quantum Nonlocality, and Applications, arXiv:1306.5772).
</p></div><h2><div>Metaphysical aspects<a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_theorem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Metaphysical aspects">Edit</a></div></h2><div><p>Most advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables.  They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local <a href="/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory" title="Hidden variable theory">hidden variable theory</a>, in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the <a href="/wiki/Bohm_interpretation" title="Bohm interpretation">Bohm interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories.<sup><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup></p><p>If the hidden variables can communicate with each other faster than light, Bell's inequality can easily be violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. One idea is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past <a href="/wiki/Light_cone" title="Light cone">light cone</a>. This is the idea behind a <a href="/wiki/Transactional_interpretation" title="Transactional interpretation">transactional interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.<sup><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></p><p>A few advocates of deterministic models have not given up on local hidden variables. For example, <a href="/wiki/Gerard_%27t_Hooft" title="Gerard 't Hooft">Gerard 't Hooft</a> has argued that the <a href="/wiki/Superdeterminism" title="Superdeterminism">superdeterminism</a> loophole cannot be dismissed.<sup><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></p><p>A possible (but not universally accepted) solution is offered by the <a href="/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" title="Many-worlds interpretation">many worlds theory</a> of quantum mechanics. According to this, not only is collapse of the wave function illusory, but the apparent random branching of possible futures when quantum systems interact with the macroscopic world is also an illusion. Measurement does not lead to a random choice of possible outcome; rather, the only ingredient of quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution of the wave function. All possibilities co-exist forever and the only reality is the quantum mechanical wave function. According to this view, two distant observers both split into superpositions when measuring a spin. The Bell inequality violations are no longer counterintuitive, because it is not clear which copy of the observer B will be seen by observer A when they compare notes. If reality includes all the different outcomes, locality in physical space (not outcome space) places no restrictions on how the split observers can meet up.
</p><p>This point underlines the fact that the argument that realism is incompatible with quantum mechanics and locality depends on a particular formalization of the concept of realism. In its weakest form, the assumption underpinning that particular formalization is called <a href="/wiki/Counterfactual_definiteness" title="Counterfactual definiteness">counterfactual definiteness</a>. This is the assumption that outcomes of measurements that are not performed are just as real as those of measurements that were performed.  Counterfactual definiteness is an uncontroversial property of all classical physical theories prior to quantum theory, due to their determinism. Many worlds interpretations are not only counterfactually indefinite, but are also factually indefinite. The results of all experiments, even ones that have been performed, are not uniquely determined.
</p><p>If one chooses to reject counterfactual definiteness, reality has been made smaller, and there is no non-locality problem. On the other hand, one is thereby introducing irreducible or intrinsic randomness into our picture of the world: randomness that cannot be "explained" as merely the reflection of our ignorance of underlying, variable, physical quantities. Non-determinism becomes a fundamental property of nature.
</p><p>Assuming counterfactual definiteness, reality has been enlarged, and there is a non-locality problem. On the other hand, in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, reality consists only of a deterministically evolving wave function and non-locality is a non-issue.
</p><p>There have also been repeated claims that Bell's arguments are irrelevant because they depend on hidden assumptions that, in fact, are questionable.  For example, <a href="/wiki/E._T._Jaynes" title="E. T. Jaynes">E. T. Jaynes</a><sup><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> claimed in 1989 that there are two hidden assumptions in Bell's theorem that could limit its generality. According to him:
</p><ol><li>Bell interpreted conditional probability P(X|Y) as a causal inference, i.e. Y exerted a causal inference on X in reality.  However, P(X|Y) actually only means logical inference (induction).  Causes cannot travel faster than light or backward in time, but deduction can.</li><li>Bell's inequality does not apply to some possible hidden variable theories. It only applies to a certain class of local hidden variable theories.  In fact, it might have just missed the kind of hidden variable theories that Einstein is most interested in.</li></ol><p>However, <a href="/wiki/Richard_D._Gill" title="Richard D. Gill">Richard D. Gill</a> has argued that Jaynes misunderstood Bell's analysis. Gill points out that in the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by <a href="/wiki/Steve_Gull" title="Steve Gull">Steve Gull</a> presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory.<sup><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> According to Jaynes (writing nearly 30 years after Bell's landmark contributions), it would probably take us another 30 years to fully appreciate Gull's stunning result.
</p><p>In 2006 a flurry of activity about implications for determinism arose with the paper: <a href="/wiki/Free_will_theorem" title="Free will theorem">The Free Will Theorem</a><sup><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> which stated "the response of a spin 1 particle to a triple experiment is free—that is to say, is not a function of properties of that part of the universe that is earlier than this response with respect to any given inertial frame."<sup><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> This theorem raised awareness of a tension between determinism fully governing an experiment (on the one hand) and Alice and Bob being free to choose any settings they like for their observations (on the other).<sup><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> The philosopher David Hodgson supports this theorem as showing that determinism is unscientific, and that quantum mechanics allows observers (at least in some instances) the freedom to make observations of their choosing, thereby leaving the door open for free will.<sup><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup></p></div><h2><div>General remarks<a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_theorem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: General remarks">Edit</a></div></h2><div><p>The violations of Bell's inequalities, due to quantum entanglement, provide near definitive demonstrations of something that was already strongly suspected: that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the classical picture of physics.<sup><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Some earlier elements that had seemed incompatible with classical pictures included <a href="/wiki/Complementarity_(physics)" title="Complementarity (physics)">complementarity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wavefunction_collapse" title="Wavefunction collapse">wavefunction collapse</a>. The Bell violations show that no resolution of such issues can avoid the ultimate strangeness of quantum behavior.<sup><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup></p><p>The EPR paper "pinpointed" the unusual properties of the entangled states, e.g. the above-mentioned singlet state, which is the foundation for present-day applications of quantum physics, such as <a href="/wiki/Quantum_cryptography" title="Quantum cryptography">quantum cryptography</a>; one application involves the measurement of quantum entanglement as a physical source of bits for <a href="/wiki/Michael_O._Rabin" title="Michael O. Rabin">Rabin's</a><a href="/wiki/Oblivious_transfer" title="Oblivious transfer">oblivious transfer</a> protocol. This non-locality was originally supposed to be illusory, because the standard interpretation could easily do away with action-at-a-distance by simply assigning to each particle definite spin-states for all possible spin directions. The EPR argument was: therefore these definite states exist, therefore quantum theory is incomplete, since they do not appear in the theory. Bell's theorem showed that the "entangledness" prediction of quantum mechanics has a degree of non-locality that cannot be explained away by any local theory.
</p><p>What is powerful about Bell's theorem is that it doesn't refer to any particular physical theory. It shows that nature violates the most general assumptions behind classical pictures, not just details of some particular models. No combination of local deterministic and local random variables can reproduce the phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics and repeatedly observed in experiments.<sup><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup></p></div><h2><div>References<a href="/w/index.php?title=Bell%27s_theorem&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Edit section: References">Edit</a></div></h2><ul><li><cite>Aspect, A.;  et al.
