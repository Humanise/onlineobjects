A <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/123566031/Reindeer-Husbandry-and-Barents-2030">2009 report</a> on the future of the practice says that there are 3,000 reindeer herders in Sweden alone, and a total of nearly 100,000 globally.</p><p>It's a family business. Inga said he took the lead from his father when he turned 18 and works alongside 17 other full-time herders in the community that includes his cousins and nephew.</p><p>Every September, reindeer are gathered and killed for meat. It’s the main source of income for the herders.</p><div><img src="/1x1.png" /></div><div>A Sami man labels a reindeer calf near the village of Dikanaess, Sweden, in 2016.Jonathan Nackstrand / AFP/Getty Images file</div><p>After the slaughter, the remaining reindeer are left to graze in the wild until it’s time for the winter migration eastward to better grazing territory. For Inga, that's a trek of more than 62 miles.</p><p>Herders follow the animals on snowmobile, spending nights in cabins along the route. Children get the time off school to take part in the process.</p><p>“Everything is connected to the reindeer and the reindeer herding,” Inga said. “It’s something you’re born and raised in.”</p><p>But Inga, who is also the chairman of the <a href="https://www.sapmi.se/">Swedish Sami Association</a>, believes "something is shifting."</p><h4>Related</h4><div><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sweden-s-tallest-peak-shrinks-extreme-heat-wave-bakes-europe-n896831?icid=related">News</a></div><h3><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sweden-s-tallest-peak-shrinks-extreme-heat-wave-bakes-europe-n896831?icid=related">Extreme heat wave shrinks Sweden's tallest peak by 13 feet in a month</a></h3><p>The snow is vital to every aspect of reindeer husbandry so this winter's erratic freeze-thaw cycle is a problem.</p><p><a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/arctic-meteorology/climate_change.html">Research suggests the effects </a>of global warming are amplified at the poles, with average air temperatures rising faster than elsewhere on the planet.

Snow also makes it easier for the Sami to track reindeer and predators.</p><p>Most importantly, the snow impacts vegetation. A delayed winter could be viewed as a good thing, allowing the reindeer more time to graze by the mountains, Inga said. But it could also lead to the reindeer trampling the plants and prompt overgrazing.</p><p>Research is backing up the changes the Sami are witnessing. Gunhild Rosqvist, a geography professor at Stockholm University, is part of a team studying the changing Arctic landscape, including the accelerating loss of glacier ice in the Scandinavian mountains.</p><h4>Related</h4><div><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/drought-brings-big-worries-farmers-across-northern-europe-n896096?icid=related">News</a></div><h3><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/drought-brings-big-worries-farmers-across-northern-europe-n896096?icid=related">Drought brings big worries for farmers across northern Europe</a></h3><p>Rosqvist is currently working with the herders to study how weather variability is impacting the animals.</p><p>It's becoming clear the animals are migrating into new areas — despite roads and other development blocking their path — which in turn is forcing herders to change their practices, she said.</p><p>The expansion of mining, wind-energy farms and tourism across northern Sweden is cutting back on the available land.</p><p>The entire town of Kiruna is being forced to move because of the neighboring iron ore mine.</p><p>“The combined pressure of all this and climate change is really pushing some of these communities over the tipping point,” Rosqvist said.</p><div><img src="/1x1.png" /></div><div>A Sami man catches a reindeer near the village of Dikanaess, Sweden.Jonathan Nackstrand / AFP/Getty Images file</div><p>Reindeer migration is just one of the many symptoms of the warming climate.</p><p>This summer saw Sweden’s highest peak lose that status due to glacial melt while wildfires spanned an unprecedented 61,775 acres across the country amid record hot and dry conditions.</p><p>A huge section of a glacier near Rosqvist's northern research station unexpectedly broke loose in an ice avalanche, she said, shocking scientists.</p><p>“It’s an emergency,” Rosqvist added. “The whole ecosystem is so delicate.”</p><p>Despite the rapid changes to the landscape, the Sami are trying to adapt.

The reindeer are semi-domesticated and bringing in food could change their behavior dramatically, he said.
