Despite feats of creativity, they <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.10.010">lack some hallmarks</a> of intelligence seen in other species. </p>
<p>“It’s an apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,” said Mr. Amodio. He and five other experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. </p>
<p>For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a car apart and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help an animal thrive. </p>
<p>That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or a knack for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed responses to survive — they can invent new behaviors on the fly.</p>
<p>To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/science/26obdolphin.html?module=inline">stick a sponge on its beak to avoid getting cuts</a> from sharp rocks and coral, for example. Or they bring animals into the lab and offer them puzzles to solve, such as rewarding crows when they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/science/crows-toolmaking.html?module=inline">learn to rip paper into strips of just the right size</a>. </p></body></html></html>
