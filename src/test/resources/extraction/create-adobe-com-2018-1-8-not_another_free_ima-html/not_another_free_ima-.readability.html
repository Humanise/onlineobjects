      <p>The Rijks Museum’s brand-awareness plan has paid off; for example, participation in the Rijksstudio Award, for which contestants make a new creation inspired by a museum piece, has exploded in numbers and global reach since it began in 2014. (“In 2017, our top 10 entries were from 9 countries,” says Volkers.)</p> 
      <p>But let’s get back to what you really care about—the freebies. To get an image, browse the website, and when you see something you like, simply click the scissor icon to download it. The only requirement is that you first register for a free account called a <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio">Rijksstudio</a>. You can browse by artist, style, subject matter, and more. Most of the collection is no longer under copyright, but if you stumble across the odd outlier, you’ll see a “not available to download” message.</p> 
      <p>NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART</p> 
      <p>How about more than <a href="https://images.nga.gov/en/page/show_home_page.html">50,000 downloadable images</a> that are OK to use for commercial purposes? That’s what the United States’ National Gallery of Art offers. Although some newer works are still under copyright, the distinction is clear—you can’t download copyrighted images, only those in the public domain. </p>
