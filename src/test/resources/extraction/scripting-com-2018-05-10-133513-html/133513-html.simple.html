	<li>Facebook is taking the place of blogs, but doesn't permit linking, styles. Posts can't have titles or include podcasts. As a result these essential features are falling into disuse. We're returning to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">AOL</a>. Linking, especially is <a href="http://scripting.com/scripting/manila/bloggerCon/ruleoflinks.html">essential</a>. <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a133600" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></li>
	<li>Click a link in a web browser, it should open a web page, not try to open an app which you may not have installed. This is what Apple does with podcasts and now news.<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a133519" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></li>
	<li>Google is forcing websites to change to support HTTPS. Sounds innocuous until you realize how many millions of historic domains won't make the switch. It's as if a library decided to burn all books written before 2000, say. The web has been used as an archival medium, it isn't up to <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/">a company</a> to decide to change that, after the fact. <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a133654" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></li>
	<li>Medium, a blogging site, is gradually closing itself off to the world. People used it for years as the place-of-record. I objected when I saw them do this, because it was easy to foresee Medium <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=medium+pivot+williams&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&amp;oq=medium+pivot+williams&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.30700j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">pivoting</a>, and they will pivot again. The final pivot will be when they go off the air entirely, as commercial blogging systems often do. <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/05/10/133513.html#a133918" title="Direct link to this item.">#</a></li>
