When using '*', '(' and '[', and ')' and ']' will be treated equal. [*,*] will include all documents with a value in the field. The interval limits may be strings, there is no need to add quotes, all the text until the comma will be treated as the start limit, and the text after that will be the end limit, for example: [Buenos Aires, New York]. Keep in mind that a string-like comparison will be done to match documents in string intervals (case-sensitive). The comparator can't be changed. Commas, brackets and square brackets can be escaped by using '\' in front of them. Whitespaces before and after the values will be omitted. Start limit can't be grater than the end limit. Equal limits are allowed, this allows you to indicate the specific values that you want to count, like [A,A], [B,B] and [C,Z].</body></html>
