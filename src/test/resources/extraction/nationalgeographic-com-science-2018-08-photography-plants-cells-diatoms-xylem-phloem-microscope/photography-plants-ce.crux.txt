Most impressive of all, plants have figured out how to eat sunlight. For billions of years, plants have harnessed the power of the sun to transmogrify carbon dioxide and water into the sugars and oxygen that fuel their growth and reproduction. Through this process, photosynthetic life also returns more than a hundred billion net tons of carbon compounds to the planet-wide system and generates a full 40 percent of the precipitation that falls on land.
