The hall is divided in two, with rows of seats facing each other, adversarially. But the first recipient of the Stephen Hawking Fellowship, apart from the professor himself who gave the initial Fellowship speech last year, was anything but combative.</p><p>Sir Jonathan Ive, Chief Design Officer at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/apple">Apple</a>, was awarded the fellowship because he fulfilled its twin criteria, as explained by Charles Connor, President of the Cambridge Union for the Michalemas term. Connor said Ive showed flair in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields and the ability to communicate complex ideas in a way to excite the imagination.</p><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jony-ive">Jony Ive</a>, as everyone calls him, made a speech that was intellectually rich but still accessible, dense with ideas and fascinating. He spoke eloquently, gently, even tenderly, about the creative process and the importance of listening to the quietest voice. Throughout, he was open and humble, repeatedly revealing the curiosity which is a central part of doing his work.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>JonyIve addressed an audience of mostly students at the Cambridge Union on 19 November, 2018 (Apple)
      </figcaption></div></figure><p>The Union’s main hall holds around 400. It was packed, mostly with students. Ive stood in the dead centre of the hall, turning back and forth between the facing rows, elegantly but quietly dressed in an immaculate blue suit, pale blue shirt and tie.</p><p>"We designers create tools, tools that you can live in, sit on, eat with, tools that enable communication and support learning, creating and mending. Our tools can be powerful, they can be beautiful, and on many occasions they're not motivated by understood or articulated needs."</p><p>But though Ive works in the world of technology, he recognises it can be challenging.</p><p>"As an aside, it's interesting, isn't it, when we struggle with technology, we assume the issue is actually with us. If you eat something that tastes dreadful, you don't assume that the issue is with you. I just thought I'd mention that."</p><figure><div><h2><title>Shape</title>iPhone XS launch in September 2018</h2><div> Show all 11</div></div><div><h1>iPhone XS launch in September 2018</h1><div><figure><figcaption><h2>1/11 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max</h2><div>Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event </div><div>REUTERS</div></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>2/11 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launch</h2><div>Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc</div><div>REUTERS</div></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>3/11 Tim Cook speaking during the event</h2><div>Tim Cook speaks during an Apple event</div><div>AFP/Getty Images</div></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>4/11 Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing</h2><div>Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max</div><div>AP</div></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>5/11 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XR</h2><div>Philip W.

Firstly, I could actually use it. I loved using it and it became a very powerful tool that helped me design and create. Secondly, and I think this is in some ways a rather embarrassing admission because this was at the end of four years of studying design, I realised that what you make represents who you are.</p><div><p>"It stands testament to your values and your preoccupations, and using the Mac I sensed a clear and direct connection with the people who actually created the Macintosh. For the first time, I remember being moved by obvious humanity and care beyond just the functional imperative. "</p><p>This, he said, led to him finding out more about the people at Apple and moving to California in 1992 to join the team.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>JonyIve was awarded the 2018 Professor Hawking Fellowship (Apple)
      </figcaption></div></figure><p>But his most interesting thoughts concerned creativity and the nature of ideas. "I spend my time at Apple in that intersection of art and technology. I think that, almost by definition, ideas are fragile. If they were resolved, if they were robust, they wouldn't be ideas any more, they would be shipping products, a finished album, a completed building. I'm not really entirely sure why, but I think I've always taken an enormous delight when the most tentative thought, often from the quietest voice, evolves into significant and substantial products."</p><p>As he described the process that surrounded one interface project which began in around 2002 to 2003, he intriguingly revealed that the concept of the Apple App Store began a long time ago.</p><p>"This was a project that we came to describe as multi-touch. Some of you may remember the first time you experienced the interface. Perhaps it was on one of the first iPhones or later on an iPad. But multi-touch describes the ability to directly touch and interact with your content to be able to pinch to zoom an image or flick through a list with your fingers.</p><p>"Importantly, it defined an opportunity to create applications with their own unique, very specific interface. So, not being generic but being specific inherently describes the application's function. We came to see that we could make applications purposeful, compelling and intuitive to use. And so, as the potential for a vast range of apps became clear, so did the idea for an app store."</p><p>But it took time before it could happen: "In reality, the supporting technology, the enabling technology, took years to catch up with the ideas. And I have to say the ideas posed problems and defined challenges, but in the process, we came close to giving up on a number of occasions."</p><p>Thankfully, they didn't give up. But ideas, he said, were not in response to a defined problems. "Nobody asked us to solve a problem. They were not in response to a technological opportunity. These ideas, they weren't vulnerable or fragile for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months, these ideas were fragile for years.</p><p>Still, after nearly 30 years at Apple, he is eager to create. "I remain completely in awe, completely enchanted by the creative process. I love the unpredicability and the surprise. The whole process is fabulously terrifying and so uncertain. But I love that on Monday, there's nothing. There is no idea, there is no conversation, the room is silent, there's certainly not a drawing. Prototypes are way in the future. On Monday, there is nothing, but on Wednesday, there is. No matter how partial, how tentative. Now, the problem is: which Wednesday?"</p><p>Collaboration is a key element, he said, even if this can lead to complexities. "Without doubt, collaborating closely with multiple experts from different disciplines is one of my favorite aspects of being part of the team at Apple but this does present challenges that are a function of working as a large group. As a larger group, opinions often become confused with ideas. Opinions expressed in larger groups tend to focus on what is measurable, tangible and can be easily evaluated and communicated. That's why there's an obsession with attributes like size and weight and speed, capacity, schedule or price. But there often follows the dangerous assumption: we talk about these attributes because we think they're important."</p><h2>Read more</h2></div></div></div></div></body></html></html>
