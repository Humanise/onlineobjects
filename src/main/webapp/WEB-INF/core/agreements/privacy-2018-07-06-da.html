<h2>Why do we store your information?</h2>
  <p>OnlineObjects is a cloud service meaning it runs and keeps information on central servers. The service is accessed via a web browser or various client apps for phones and PCs etc.</p>

  <h3>Benefits of central storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Information can be accessed / synchronized between devices.</li>
      <li>The information is backed up if you loose your device.</li>
      <li>Central servers can perform more advanced logic and runs around the clock.</li>
      <li>Logic can be improved centrally without updating the clients.</li>
      <li>Information can be shared between people if wanted.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Problems with central storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Unauthorized people may gain access to the information</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Why is an e-mail required?</h2>
  <p>We would prefer not to store users e-mails but we have found it necessary for the following reasons...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Give the user the ability to reset their password.</li>
    <li>Send messages about problems with their account.</li>
    <li>Alert users about logins from new devices.</li>
    <li>Notify users about changes to terms or policy.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>How do we handle passwords?</h2>
  <p>Password are stored in an encrypted form on the server. This makes it difficult for people with access to the database to know the password.</p>
  <p>Note that it is theoretically possible for a skilled programmer with large computing power to decrypt the password.</p>

<h2>Who has access to the information?</h2>
  <p>The system is not designed to keep sensitive information completely secret. We are not able to guarantee that only the user has access to their own information.</p>
  <p>The following people have the ability to gain access to user data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers at Humanise</li>
    <li>System administrators at the hosting company</li>
    <li>Government agencies with law in hand</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Criminals may gain access to the data</li>
    <li>Intelligence agencies may intercept data</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Sharing of data</h2>
  <p>We do not deliberately share your data with anyone. We see the following circumstances where sharing of data may occur:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Local laws compels us to hand over data to the government.</li>
    <li>Criminals get access to the data.</li>
    <li>We introduce errors in the software that exposes data to the wrong people.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Where do we store your information?</h2>
  <p>The information is currently stored on servers in Germany within the European Union. A backup of the data exists on a hard drive in Denmark that is not powered on and therefore not connected to the internet.</p>

<h2>How long do we store your information?</h2>

  <p>Unfortunately, we may not be able to remove all traces of you activity if you request it.</p>
